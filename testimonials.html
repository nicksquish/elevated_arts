            <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left float-left p-2" style="color:gray"></i>Jeremy has a real kind and gentle spirit that I noticed right away.
              Getting a reading from him was one of the smartest   things I have ever
              done. He was the push I needed to move forward in living my life purpose.
               I am so looking forward to my next reading from him!<i class="fa fa-quote-right float-right p-2" style="color:gray"></i><br><b><i>-AJaye</i></b>

            <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left float-left p-2" style="color:gray"></i>I met Jeremy about a year ago and I was drawn to his amazing energy.
              So welcoming and heartwarming. His readings are always given with so much
              wisdom and truth. I have been able to connect with my spirit guides, past
              lives and Saints through his channeling. He has helped guide and reawaken
              my gifts and personal journey. I always look forward to when I have an
              upcoming reading scheduled with him. He is a bright light that the world<i class="fa fa-quote-right float-right p-2" style="color:gray"></i>
              needs and I am happy to call him my friend!<br><b><i>-Christine</i></b>

              <i class="fa fa-quote-left float-left p-2" style="color:gray"></i>Jeremy is truly a gifted and compassionate person! Upon our first appointment,
               I discovered how very caring, intuitive and compassionate Jeremy is. He
                utilizes all his resources, guides and special people in your life that
                have passed to give a meaningful and impactful reading. I was amazed at
                the accuracy of his messages. I have met with Jeremy several times over
                the past 6 months and will continue to do so because his readings have
                been extremely positive and helpful for me. I am sure you will find how<i class="fa fa-quote-right float-right p-2" style="color:gray"></i>

              <i class="fa fa-quote-left float-left p-2" style="color:gray"></i>I must say that Jeremy is an outstanding and gifted new reader on the scene.
               He is very young, but his readings reflect a maturity beyond his twenty-one
               years. There is no doubt he is receiving messages and directions and insights
               from the other side. He astounds you with his right-on input regarding your
               family and friends who have transitioned. It is so comforting to receive direct
               communications when he channels Archangel Michael. This opens one up to new
               directions, and the love from the other side just emanates from him. I am
               telling all my friends, most of whom are metaphysical enthusiasts like myself,
               to utilize the in-depth feedback that Jeremy will provide. His readings leave
               you with a sense of being guided and in good hands with your angels, spirit
               guides, and your loved ones assisting you in your earthly journey.  Do not <i class="fa fa-quote-right float-right p-2" style="color:gray"></i>

                and I am STILL being guided by those words in our first session. Jeremy helps you see these
                 things in yourself that you've overlooked and he helps facilitate in putting you back in 
                 tune with the person you are and how that relates to how you exist within your own life. 
                 He gave me knowledge of past lives, gave me a better perspective of current/past/future

               of service. He exists on earth to help people heal - emotionally, physically, spiritually.
                He is humble and genuinely cares, and he realizes that healing is facilitation. He gives 
                his clients the tools they need to do the work of healing themselves, because that is the
                 only way one truly heals. He is very gentle in challenging situations and always makes 
                 sure that a person knows they are loved and they have helpers, and he helps them access
                  that love and aid so they can move forward on their path. Personally, my reading helped
                   me on so many levels. It gave me clarity and helped clear a lot of emotional baggage 
                   and he sent me home with some easy tasks that kept me growing and expanding. Jeremy

              <i class="fa fa-quote-left float-left p-2" style="color:gray"></i>I met Jeremy about a year
               and a half ago now and I make sure to visit with him at least once a quarter. His guidance 
               and spiritual gifts have been instrumental in my self discovery of whom I truly am and how
                to best live my life as that person. I wish I would have met him sooner but I look forward 
                to being a lifelong client and friend in the years to come. He truly is a gift to this 
                earth and he will use his gifts to serve you well.<i class="fa fa-quote-right float-right p-2" style="color:gray"></i>

              <i class="fa fa-quote-left float-left p-2" style="color:gray"></i>The environment that 
              Jeremy provides is so encouraging and supportive. He has educated me on a variety ways 
              to better myself and to improve my overall mental and emotional health. Anyone who 
              desires to better themselves, heal, and to build a closer relationship with our higher
               power, I highly recommend that you attend a class or schedule a reading with Jeremy.

              <i class="fa fa-quote-left float-left p-2" style="color:gray"></i>Jeremy is able to read 
              energy. He works with energy and spirits. He is knowledgeable and intuitive. He points 
              you in the right direction and tells you ...it is up to you to do the rest.
