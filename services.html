              Intuitive Spiritual Reading
              <hr>
            </h2>
            <p>Jeremy is an Intuitive Empath, which means that he uses his Intuition (the ability
              to acquire knowledge without proof, or conscious reasoning) and being Empathic (being
              able to sense/feel what others are feeling, either emotionally, physically, spiritually,
               mentally or energetically) to conduct a Reading. During a session, Jeremy utilizes
               a system his Guides have taught him. This includes a blend of pulling Crystals,
               Oracle Cards, reading one’s Energy Fields and Channeling Intuitive messages from
               his Guides and yours. In session, Jeremy becomes a Spiritual Medium, a bridge between
               this World and the Spirit World. The energies he may sense around you as Guides, and
               connect you with can range from Passed loved ones, Angels, Ascended Masters, Spirit
               Guides, Saints, Animal Totems, your Higher-Self and anything in between. This depends
               on which type of energy is needed to bring the message through. A reading with Jeremy
               is recommended for those that feel stuck or looking for confirmation(s) on a specific
                subject or issue that one is struggling with or if you are looking for direction and
                guidance, but there certainly is no need for a specific issue to receive a reading.
                Jeremy will share messages from your Guides, and give you tools to help you take the
                 next steps on your Journey. This will help with one’s healing process as well as the
                  Evolution of one’s own spirit. Jeremy is honored to be utilizing his gifts to help
                   others & is grateful to be a part of your Journey. </p>

               Aura Art Sessions
               <hr>
             </h2>
             <p>An Aura Art Session consists of Jeremy channeling the energy of your Auric Field into
               a drawing. The image is then interpreted by Jeremy to help you connect and understand
                it even deeper. This session may help one to see what areas of their energy may need
                more work, and to confirm areas that look very positive. Guides, Spirits, Past lives,
                Symbols and more may appear in the art and bring a deeper meaning to the image and one's
                 connection to their energy field. These help to bring a visual component to a usually
                 invisible energy, it helps the naked eye see what surrounds us.</p>
